The vise package language is used for writing package methods.
It's a simple stack based language.
Each command takes an "argument", and possibly more from the stack.
The simplest command is #, which pushes its argument onto the stack.

List of all 34 commands:

. -- comment
# arg -- push the argument onto the stack
set arg -- stores the top of stack into the var arg
get arg -- pushes the value of the var arg onto the stack
echo -- prints out the top of stack
dup -- duplicate the top of stack
drop -- pop the top of stack

  All the following commands pop a path off the top of the stack, and do the obvious:
mkdir
mkdir-marked -- puts a vise.mark file in the directory, so you can delete it.
file-delete
dir-delete
cd

  Commands I'll document later:
getbest
join
depends
untar
run-script
exe
rel-exe
unexe
rel-unexe
file-exists
mark
delete-tree
==
if
fi
not
crash
check
mild-check
warn
done
